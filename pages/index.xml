Try to record at several distances, adjusting the gain but increasing the distance from the microphone to sound source, starting in the intimate zone and then moving farther out. What are the changes you notice in the sound acoustically and perceptually?
Recordings can either focus on specific things such as a bird or a car driving by, or be an ambience, where the focus is on the wider soundscape.</description></item><item><title>Resources</title><link>/pages/resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/resources/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Review of Sound, Listening and Place: The aesthetic dilemma</title><link>/pages/lectures/week-4/truax-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/lectures/week-4/truax-review/</guid><description>Audio examples from reading Sonification &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Phonology &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Virtual Soundscapes Sonification Audication of the sun Sonification of median household incomes along a subway line in NYC John Luther Adams - The Place Where You Go to Listen - an example of a sound sculpture, driven by data.
