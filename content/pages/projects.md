## Project 1

Make 10 field recordings, either on a Zoom portable recorder or your phone. Try to record at several distances, adjusting the gain but increasing the distance from the microphone to sound source, starting in the intimate zone and then moving farther out. What are the changes you notice in the sound acoustically and perceptually?

Recordings can either focus on specific things such as a bird or a car driving by, or be an ambience, where the focus is on the wider soundscape.

For each recording write a description of the recording including the time of day, the weather conditions, location, and what it is that you're recording.

## Project 2 - Transformation Formula

Follow Marc Weidenbaums instructions here.


The field recordings from last project must form the basis of the composition. Keep the composition between 3-5 minutes so we can listen to them all in class.


In addition to those basic instructions use a digital reverb and a convolution reverb to put your sounds is different spaces than they were recorded in. You can convolve with any interesting sound, or even convole a sound with itself as Truax mentions in his article. Extreme use of convolution reverb can drastically change the sound, experiment with this.


Write a paragraph about your compositional process. What was your goal with the work? What was your process? What did you want to do but couldn't figure out how? What was your transformation?
