## Project 1

Make 10 field recordings, either on a Zoom portable recorder or your phone. Try to record at several distances, adjusting the gain but increasing the distance from the microphone to sound source, starting in the intimate zone and then moving farther out. What are the changes you notice in the sound acoustically and perceptually?

Recordings can either focus on specific things such as a bird or a car driving by, or be an ambience, where the focus is on the wider soundscape.

For each recording write a description of the recording including the time of day, the weather conditions, location, and what it is that you're recording.

## Project 2 - Transformation Formula

Follow Marc Weidenbaum's instructions here.


The field recordings from last project must form the basis of the composition. Keep the composition between 3-5 minutes so we can listen to them all in class.


In addition to those basic instructions use a digital reverb and a convolution reverb to put your sounds is different spaces than they were recorded in. You can convolve with any interesting sound, or even convolve a sound with itself as Truax mentions in his article. Extreme use of convolution reverb can drastically change the sound, experiment with this.


Write a paragraph about your compositional process. What was your goal with the work? What was your process? What did you want to do but couldn't figure out how? What was your transformation?


Rubric


* 10 points work is 3-5 minutes
* 10 points uses Digital reverb
* 10 points - uses convolution reverb
* 10 points - writing about the compositional process


## Project 3 

## Final Project

Choose one of the animation shorts from Prof. Konrad's class and compose a score and sound effects for it. 

### Sound Effects

Every action in the short that could make a sound should have a sound effect. If there character moves we should hear its footsteps etc. Think of sound effects in layers of foreground, middle ground and background. Here are some general rules to use: 

*  If the sound effect happens several times (e.g., punching during a fight scene), find several variations of the sound. Repeating the same sound over and over comes across like a video game, not like a movie.
*  Realism is not always desirable. When movie characters draw swords, they make loud metallic sounds like knives being sharpened. The actual sound of a sword being drawn is dull. An action scene often requires heightened or exaggerated sounds.
*  If the object doesn’t exist or recordings aren’t available, consider how to substitute sounds for it. For example, you could make the sound of a falling boulder by recording a small rock being dropped and then lowering the recording’s pitch.
*  Film is never entirely silent. Even if there is no action happening there will always be some sort of ambient sound or room tone. Total silence sounds awkward to our ears, as there is (almost) never total silence in our daily lives. 
*  Have the spatial position of action on the screen reflected in the panning. Think about how a car driving across the screen sounds in a big movie. 

You must use a DAW that allows for SMPTE timing, which shows **Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames**. This will allow you to align your music and SFX to the correct time.

Use the techniques we've learned in class to create your sound effects, this includes: field recording, studio recording, and sound synthesis. You may use sound effects you find from sources online or libraries. The difficulty in sound design is laying and combining these sounds to create a cohesive soundscape. 

Sometimes the easiest way to create your sound effects may be to record your own. Remember, sound effects are almost never just one sound, they're usually a series of sounds that are layered together. So, even if you find prerecorded sounds, you will have to layer them together to create convincing effects.

### Music 

The score should include contrasting pieces to match each scene. There can be occasional silences for dramatic effect, but music should heard through most of the short. Use any of the techniques we've learned over the semester to build and release tension in the scenes. **No loops should be used, all composition should be your own.**

### Mixing 

The music and sound effects must be mixed so that they do not clash with each other. 

**Turn in a rendered version of your video and a consolidated project file.**
