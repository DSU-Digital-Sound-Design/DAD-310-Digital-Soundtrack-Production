## Project 1

Make 10 field recordings, either on a Zoom portable recorder or your phone. Try to record at several distances, adjusting the gain but increasing the distance from the microphone to sound source, starting in the intimate zone and then moving farther out. What are the changes you notice in the sound acoustically and perceptually?

Recordings can either focus on specific things such as a bird or a car driving by, or be an ambience, where the focus is on the wider soundscape.

For each recording write a description of the recording including the time of day, the weather conditions, location, and what it is that you're recording.
