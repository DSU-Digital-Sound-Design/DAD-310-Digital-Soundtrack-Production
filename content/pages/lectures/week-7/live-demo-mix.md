## Tracks

### Drum Rack 

* See drum rack busses 
* Signal is routed to a kick, snare, or hihat bus, each with a variety of effects on them. 
* See automation on snare bus and hihat bus effects 

### Perc choice 

* cut out the lows on the pandeiro so we only hear the high hat, overdrive to add some crunch 

### Clap loop 

* Multiband compression 

### Hihat Loop 

* sidechain compression 
    * the compressor is taking audio as an input from the drum rack
    * the threshold is set so that only the kickdrum triggers the compressor
    * the effect is that the hihat loop is ducked so it doesn't clash with the kick drum  

### Break loop 

* multiband compression helps bring the elements together, it needs this because there are is a wide range of frequencies in the break loop 
* see the automation on delay time, this is just to give the break loop some variation 
* the effect of the delay is to make the loop sound thicker and wider as the delay time is 13.5 ms, too short to sound like an actual repeat 
* and again there compressor taking the drum rack as an input, ducking out of the way, making space in the mix 

### Vocals track group 

* Tracks are grouped together so we can add effects to them all at once
* See the automation on the delay, turning it on and off in different sections 
* The EQ and saturator make the vocals stand out in the mix without making them louder
* reverb add some body, it can't really be heard in the mix as reverb
* the compressor then brings the volume of the sound down without effecting its loudness 
* again there's a sidechain compressor, but this time it isn't doing as much work as before 
* on the extra line track the filter is automated and also the speaker is turned off so that at a certain point we only hear the reverb tail of the vocals, as applied by the vocal group  
* on the vocals hum track a gate is used to create a rhythmic effect 
    * gates are sort of like reverse compressors, only allowing the sound to play if it reaches a certain threshold  
    * here the threshold is automated to only have the effect happen at certain points 

### White Noise 

* Sidechain audio from break loop 

### Granular FX 

* almost inaudible when listening to the whole mix, but when you take it away you loose some sparkle 
* some cool effects
* hybrid reverb
* grain delay
* spectral resonator 

### Bass sub + Bass short 

* automated mutes to create a rhythmic effect
