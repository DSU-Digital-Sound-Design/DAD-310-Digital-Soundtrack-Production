* Sounds in space - four dimensions
* three cartesian dimensions - 
    * x (left to right), 
        * controlled by panning     
    * y (top to bottom), 
        * pitch perception, higher frequencies sound high on the y axis  
    * z (front to back) 
        1. Louder sounds appear closer to us.
        2. Sounds without reverb (when used in conjunction with sounds
with reverb) will sound closer to us (since the reverberation
implies a space between us and the sounds).
        3. Sounds that have been closely miked will appear closer to us.
        4. Sounds with unusual effects tend to stick out and appear closer to
        5. Sounds with hard compression (see below) will appear closer to us.
        6. Sounds with more high-frequency components will appear closer to us.
        7. Discrete sounds against an ambient bed will tend to appear closer to us (e.g., the back-up beepers on a truck against the white noise of a construction site).
