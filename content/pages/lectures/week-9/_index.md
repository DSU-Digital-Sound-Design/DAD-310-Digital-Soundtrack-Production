What gives sounds their meaning?

## Conditioning 

> Conditioning is a psychological behavioral process in which our response becomes learned over time as a result of being reinforced by repetition or extreme circumstances.

## Pavlov's Dog

The classic example is the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who in the 1890s ran studies of his dogs responding to being fed. In these studies a bell was rung every time the dogs were fed, and the dogs came to associate the sound of the bell with food. Pavlov could then ring a bell and the dogs would salivate. 

Dogs are still trained in this way for bomb and drug sniffing. Human's also respond to conditioning, especially with sound.

Conditioning is used in product, film, and game sound to make the listener associate sound with certain events

We're conditioned to hear this sound and think of the approaching shark

This also works with video games 

Here the high pitched coin sound makes sense for a good game action. And a lower pitch sound makes sense to us for something bad happening.
