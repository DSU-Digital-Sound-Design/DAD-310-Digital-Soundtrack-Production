## Starting a cue 

In general, music starts most effectively at a moment of shifting emphasis. This might be expressed as:

1. A new emotional emphasis or subject in the dialogue.
2. A new visual emphasis with the camera.
3. A camera move in connection with emotional emphasis; camera moves are almost
always conceived for emphasis.
4. A new action, such as a car driving off, a person leaving the room, a cop ducking
behind a barrier.
5. A reaction to something that has been said or has occurred (note that this is also an emotional response).
   
Sometimes this new emphasis coincides with an editorial cut to a new shot or angle; keep in mind that the edit isn’t the focus of the drama—it is the drama that is the center of our attention. If the best place to start is on a cut, fine. However, it is just as effective to start between cuts. Let the drama, not the editing, be the motivation to start the music.

## How to Start

Do you start the cue with an aggressive, accented entrance, or with a soft lead-in? The sole criterion is the style and nature of the film and the function of the score at that particular moment. Directorial preference will be important also. Some directors and composers dislike stingers (heavy music accents on a dramatic shot or moment, like the discovery of a dead body or the reaction to a villain’s verbal threat), especially at the start of a cue. In broad comedy or heavy melodrama, these musical accents may be appropriate. This is called “hitting the action” or “catching the action” (see Chapter 10). On the other hand, a soft entrance on a dramatic moment or emotional reaction shot can elicit a very strong response from the audience. It can be chilling, ominous, threatening, poignant. If in doubt, discuss this with the director, as the ways in which your score plays the drama is an extremely significant factor.


## When to End

Just as you will start a cue for emotional emphasis (whether soft or loud) you will end either for emphasis or de-emphasis, at a moment when the dramatic moment or action shifts again (to a different subject, level of emotion, or visual or scene). Sometimes the cut or dissolve to the next scene will feel like the perfect place to end the cue, tailing out under the following dialogue. Sometimes the intrusion of another person or element in an emotional scene or reverie will break the mood, and the music, following this shift in emphasis, will tail out at that time.
Sometimes there just doesn’t seem to be a good place to get out of the cue—no convenient sound effect to cover music going out, no timely cut to the next scene. The scene just keeps going, but the music goes out, without apparent motivation. For some reason, this can work better than you would guess. Sometimes when the music goes out, even if it seems arbitrary, it will slightly emphasize the next dialogue or action, and in so doing becomes a part of the dramatic fabric. The reasons for ending a cue in the middle of a scene are: (1) the music has gone on as long as it should, and to continue will diminish its effectiveness; (2) the music must enter again shortly, and will be much more effective dramatically if there has been a silence prior to the new entrance; (3) if allowed to continue, the music will actually hurt the dramatic impact of the scene, even though it has been needed up to this point.
