        *  [Leah Barclay](http://leahbarclay.com/portfolio/) - Many works of soundscape that involve a deep connection to the environment they come from, including workshops with local residents and in depth research into the environment she's recording. See her [TEDx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4fL76TGqIY) talk.
        *  Barry Truax's Island
            * <audio src="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/excerpts/Island%20Ex.mp3" controls>   
            * Island is a 16-track soundscape composition that blends natural acoustic environmental sounds with processed versions of the same sounds. The result is a visit to an imaginary island imbued with magical realism, beginning at the shoreline, proceeding up a rapidly flowing stream, visiting a resonant cistern, climbing to the windy peak of a mountain lake, descending again through a nighttime forest of crickets, and ending at a different shoreline.
