This tool is great for creating variations of sound effects. You can download it [here](https://www.lkctools.com/variator). This tool only works with Reaper. 

## Installation 

Before installing Variator you need two tools, [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) and [the SWS / S&M extension](https://www.sws-extension.org/). After you install those, follow these installation instructions for Variator:

## Usage Basics 

Variator can vary all sorts of parameters. Drop some audio files into your Reaper session and select the Position setting. The Radiation amount is the amount of effect that setting will have on the clips. The position of the clips will stay inside of your time selection. You can also make several variations at once by having multiple regions using the same clips. 

Create variations in speed by selecting Tape/Stretch. Values over 50 will select the "preserve pitch when changing rate" property and values under 50 will deselect the "preserve pitch when changing rate" property.

Content moves the contents of your items around. This only works if you have the items looping. 

## Formulas and Randomization 

Randomize is a good way of finding unique variations. If you find a random setting that you like you can save it in the formulas section. 

Be careful with selecting the File DNA setting. Selecting this will edit your imported audio files. This is risky if you have not copied the files into your project. You could accidentals edit your original recordings. The safest thing to do is to make sure you have copied the files into your project before using Variator.

## Chernobyl

This setting is similar to randomize but cuts the clips first. This setting can be very extreme, use with caution. Its probably a good idea to use it on only a few selected clips. 

## Decontaminate 

This setting restores the volume, pan, pitch, tape/stretch, and rate settings of your clips. Use this if you went to far and want to return back to your starting point without having to re-import your audio files.
