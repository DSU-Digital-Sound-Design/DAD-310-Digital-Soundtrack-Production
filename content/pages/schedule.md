   All about Sound - The basics of acoustics and psychoacoustics as they specifically relate to sound design 

   **Tuesday 8/31**

   In class assignment: Make a 2-3 minute composition based on your notes from the sound walk or silent sit inside. You can use whatever software you are familiar with. Approaches can range from the literal to the metaphorical; just be creative. What does it mean to compose a work with a moving listener perspective; or a fixed perspective? How do you portray motion with sound?
   
   All sounds (sampled or synthesized) and styles are welcome. Post your journal entry along with the composition to the discussion board on D2L. We will listen to our results in class on Thursday.

   First upload the stems of your track and add them to your thread on the forum. If you need help with this step, we can go over it. Use a different program than you used to create your track. When starting your remix, download the stems from one of your classmates and load them into your DAW.
   
   If you used Soundtrap, try Ableton or Logic. Explore the differences between the DAWs. You may add sounds or instruments to the remix but you must keep elements of the original. 

   When you're done, post your remix as a response on the thread to the classmate you remixed.
