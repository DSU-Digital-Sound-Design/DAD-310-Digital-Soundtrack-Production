   All about Sound - The basics of acoustics and psychoacoustics as they specifically relate to sound design 

   **Tuesday 8/31**

   In class assignment: Make a 2-3 minute composition based on your notes from the sound walk or silent sit inside. You can use whatever software you are familiar with. Approaches can range from the literal to the metaphorical; just be creative. What does it mean to compose a work with a moving listener perspective; or a fixed perspective? How do you portray motion with sound?
   
   All sounds (sampled or synthesized) and styles are welcome. Post your journal entry along with the composition to the discussion board on D2L. We will listen to our results in class on Thursday.

   First upload the stems of your track and add them to your thread on the forum. If you need help with this step, we can go over it. Use a different program than you used to create your track. When starting your remix, download the stems from one of your classmates and load them into your DAW.
   
   If you used Soundtrap, try Ableton or Logic. Explore the differences between the DAWs. You may add sounds or instruments to the remix but you must keep elements of the original. 

   When you're done, post your remix as a response on the thread to the classmate you remixed.

   ## Sound and meaning

   **Tuesday 10/19**

   * Please submit consolidated versions of your project files for the sing song project. 
   * Finish listening to the other projects 
   * [Sound and meaning](pages/lectures/week-9/)
   * Look at Ableton synthesizers

   HOMEWORK: Listen to the [Twenty Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org/episodes/soundmarks) episode on soundmarks as inspiration for the project.

   Sonic logo/device sounds Project Due Tuesday 10/26: This project has two options, one where you create sounds for a device or software and anther where you create a sonic logo for a company. Use the ideas we talked about in class about conditioning and sonic archetypes. Take some inspiration from [Defacto Sound](https://www.defactosound.com/), the company that produces Twenty Thousand Hertz.  

   Device sounds: Pick a device that you own and recompose the sounds for it. You could choose one function like texting. Notice all the different sounds that are used to help the user understand the interface. Create sounds for at least five different actions. Make three versions of each action. In the end you will have 15 distinct sounds. 

   Sonic logo: Pick three companies and compose a sonic logo that represent each of them. For each company compose five versions of the sonic logo. 

   Submit a few sentences about each sound, describing what its for and why it works for that purpose. For the sonic logo describe how the sounds connect to the companies wider brand. 

   **Thursday 10/21**

   * Discuss the Twenty Thousand Hertz podcast
   * Guardian Podcasts Sonic Logo 
   * Radiolab podcast has some more really interesting sounds
   * More synths in Ableton  
      * Operator 
      * Wavetable  
   * work on soundmarks/device sounds
